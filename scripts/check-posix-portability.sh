# [汎用core] POSIX 移植性ゲート — 出荷スクリプトが POSIX sh で動くことを保証する
# gatecrate's scripts are POSIX `sh`, so they run the same from bash and zsh, from fish (which still
# EXECUTES them via the `#!/bin/sh` shebang), and on Windows via Git Bash / WSL. The user's
# interactive shell does not matter for an executed script — the shebang picks `/bin/sh`. This gate
# keeps that true by failing on the two ways a bashism sneaks in:
#   1. a non-`#!/bin/sh` shebang (a `#!/bin/bash` line would make shellcheck lint in bash dialect, so
#      bashisms would pass silently). Sourced files declaring `# shellcheck shell=sh` are exempt.
#   2. shellcheck SC3xxx — a construct UNDEFINED in POSIX sh (arrays, `[[ ]]`, `echo -e`, …).
# `sh -n` (dash on CI) already catches non-POSIX *syntax*; this adds the *semantic* bashisms and the
# shebang guard. shellcheck is needed for check 2; if absent, check 1 still runs (and says so).
#
# Scope: every tracked `*.sh` plus install.sh. Override with POSIX_CHECK_PATHS (space-separated).
